## Detailed Explanation of Core Features
As a dedicated plugin focusing on world identification display, WorldTag abandons redundant functions and focuses on the accurate implementation of core needs. Every function is optimized and designed to balance ease of use and stability.

### 1. Automatic Mounting of Player Name World Tags
The core function of the plugin is to automatically add an identification tag corresponding to the current world before players' names, realizing intuitive visualization of players' locations. Whenever players switch between different worlds on the server, the tags will be updated in real time without manual operation by administrators. This allows all online players to quickly identify the current world location of target players, facilitating cross-world interaction guidance between players, helping administrators quickly locate players' scenarios, and improving server management efficiency.

### 2. Customizable Adaptation of Tag Text and Color
The plugin supports highly flexible tag customization. Server administrators can freely configure the display text and color parameters of each world tag according to their server's operation style and world themes (such as Survival World, Creative World, Dungeon World, etc.). Through simple configuration operations, the tag text can be accurately matched with the server's world names. Meanwhile, color parameters can be used to distinguish different world types, enhancing the recognition of tags, making world tags not only practical but also consistent with the overall visual style of the server.

### 3. Comprehensive Fault-Tolerance Adaptation Mechanism
To ensure the stable operation of the plugin, WorldTag has built-in intelligent fault-tolerance logic with special optimization for abnormal configuration file scenarios. When the plugin reads the configuration file, if it cannot recognize the target world folder on the server (such as abnormal folder naming, path changes, missing world files, etc.), it will automatically trigger the fault-tolerance mechanism and display the corresponding world tag as [Unknown]. This design can effectively avoid plugin errors, crashes or display disorders caused by configuration abnormalities, ensuring the plugin runs normally in various complex configuration environments.

## Core Advantages of the Plugin
### Lightweight Design with Low Resource Consumption
The plugin adopts a streamlined development logic, eliminating all non-core redundant code for an extremely compact size. It occupies minimal server resources during operation and does not impose any additional burden on server performance indicators such as TPS. It supports various deployment scenarios including small private servers and large public servers, and runs smoothly even on servers with limited resource configurations.

### Zero Dependencies for Easy Deployment
WorldTag does not require the installation of any extra dependency plugins or libraries. After downloading the plugin file, you can directly put it into the server plugin directory to complete deployment, without complex configuration and debugging. This greatly reduces the deployment cost and operation difficulty for server administrators. Both novice administrators and senior operation and maintenance personnel can quickly install and enable the plugin to implement world tag functions rapidly.

## Applicable Scenarios and Summary
WorldTag is suitable for all Minecraft servers with a multi-world architecture, whether it is a comprehensive server with coexisting modes such as Survival, Creative and Adventure, or a dedicated server focusing on specific gameplay. The plugin can realize standardized display of world identifications. Its features of lightweight, zero dependencies and high fault tolerance perfectly solve the pain points of inconvenient player world positioning and unclear identification in multi-world servers, while balancing server performance and management convenience.

In conclusion, WorldTag is a "small yet sophisticated" dedicated identification plugin. Guided by core functions and based on stability, it can add practical world identification functions to the server without complex operations. It not only improves the interactive experience of players but also helps administrators optimize server management efficiency, making it an ideal auxiliary plugin for multi-world Minecraft servers.
